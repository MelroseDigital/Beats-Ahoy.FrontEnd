   ![](baAssets/img2.svg)

## Description
Beats Ahoy is a personal music streaming application, with a twist. Generate personal playlists aligned with your current mood and preferences. Upon completion of a short proprietary questionnaire, a playlist of up to 20 songs is generated, based on input. The questionnaire is designed to gauge energy-level, emotional & environmental factors (weather), and then match metrics such as tempo, liveliness, dancability, etc, returning a playlist matching your current "vibe".  Multiple playlists can be created/stored/accessed.
