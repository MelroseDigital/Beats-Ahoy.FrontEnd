             <img src="./beats2.svg" alt="" />

## Description
BeatsAhoy allows its users to create an account and login to create a specialized playlist based off the following attributes. (Current Mood, Time of Day, Energy Level, Spontaneous level). These attributes are placed on a scale from 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest. The following attributes are asked in a quiz like format. The results are then saved on the users profile along with a link to the playlist generated on the Spotify platform. The users can see all of the recently created playlists as well as their created playlists on the dashboard page.
